                    This is not my first webpage!  I had my first experience with HTML in highschool, 
                    at the time I thought a page all about cheese was going to be pretty tasty.  At 
                    the time I didn't have a strong interest in learning about web development.  The biggest
                    think I have learned so far is the value of HTML.  Recently, I changed from trying to focus
                    on backend development to a full stack strategy.  I'm also learning that html can  be a lot 
                    of fun.  I've found this track be to be energizing and inspiring!

                        <li>the relationship between http and html</li>
                        <li>email protocols are a web standard</li>

                            it was Tim-Berners Lee! (kind of)

                    I've also found it interesting to learn about how html, css and javascript 
                    each contribute to a working website.
                    <br>These websites have been great resources:
