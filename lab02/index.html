                    This is not my first webpage!  I had my first experience with HTML in highschool, 
                    at the time I thought a page all about cheese was going to be pretty tasty.  At 
                    the time I didn't have a strong interest in learning about web development.  The biggest
                    think I have learned so far is the value of HTML.  Recently, I changed from trying to focus
                    on backend development to a full stack strategy.  I'm also learning that html can  be a lot 
                    of fun.  I've found this track be to be energizing and inspiring!

                        <ol>
                            <li>The relationship between http and html</li>
                            <li>Email protocols are a web standard</li>
                            <li>Al Gore didn't invent the Internet!
                            <br>
                            it was Tim-Berners Lee! (kind of)
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I've also found it interesting to learn about how html, css and javascript 
                        each contribute to a working website.
